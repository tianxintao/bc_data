# bc_data

### Background
This is the project that I worked on during the [BC Data Workshop](http://workshop.bcdata.ca/2018/) in 2018 summer. The Jupyter Notebook functions can not be run because the data is missing. The data is confidential so I don't have access to it either.

### My Contribution
The main achievement for me including:
1. Plotting ship path with folium
2. Interpolating the ship path points with cubic spline
3. Find similar denser ship path in the history log for a recent spaser ship path using KNN algorithm.
